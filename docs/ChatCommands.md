# Chat Commands

## Use Skill

This command is the replacement of GWToolbox's useskill since this will count into the current energy and has no artificial skill delay.

The command to start useskill for a certain skill (number) is:

```
/use [1-8]
```

The command to stop useskill is one of the following:

```
/use 0
/use
```

## Dhuum

This is a smart useskill for the Dhuum fight.  
While the progress bar is not finished, *Rest* is cast.  
If the progress bar is finished but Dhuum is not below 25%, the damage skill is cast.  
If the player is not attacking Dhuum, auto-attacking will be started.

The command to start Dhuum useskil is:

```
/dhuum start
```

The command to stop useskill is one of the following:

```
/dhuum stop
/dhuum
```

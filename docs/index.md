# HelperBox for GuildWars

This software is based on the GWCA API and has some utilities for (low-man) UWSC.

If you want to use ToolBox++ in parallel, you have to start Toolbox **before** starting this HelperBox.  
You *may* need to launch the HelperBox.exe as admin.  

Note: Thw UW Helper Windows are only displayed in Embark Beach and in the Underworld.
